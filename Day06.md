# Today,

- I read articles about React Hooks (useMemo, useCallback, useRef, useContext etc.), event-driven architecture and I learned in which cases UseState, UseEffect should not be used.

- I learned what **memoization** is.

- I learned how to build my own hooks.

- I tried to figure out API logic of my company's frontend project.
